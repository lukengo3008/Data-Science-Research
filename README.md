# Data-Science-Research: PREVENTING ECO-ANXIETY IN ORPHANS: ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL WORKER-CHILD BONDING USING REGRESSION

## Abstract
Eco-anxiety, characterized by ongoing concerns about the future of the Earth and its ecosystems, is recognized as a significant 
psychological state. Children, who have limited influence over environmental matters, are particularly susceptible to eco-anxiety. 
Orphaned children, lacking familial support systems, are a vulnerable group requiring dedicated research to understand and address 
their unique needs. This paper aims to investigate how alternative family-child bonding influences environmental concerns and coping 
mechanisms for eco-anxiety in orphaned children and suggest strategies for fostering resilience in this population. The research uses 
quantitative methods to measure the correlation between family-child bonding and environmental awareness, focusing on gender as a 
potential moderating factor. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study found that stronger reported family bonds were 
significantly associated with higher levels of environmental awareness. Children who rated their family relationships as very or 
extremely good were more likely to demonstrate deeper understanding and concern for environmental issues, as evidenced by higher 
scores in structured questionnaire responses. These findings suggest that the cognitive aspects of family bonding may play a crucial role 
in shaping children's environmental consciousness. The insights gained can guide targeted interventions for at-risk orphaned children.
